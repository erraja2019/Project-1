# Project-1
The full-stack E-Commerce project developed in PHP during my training at ACMGRADE features separate interfaces for sellers and clients. This comprehensive website integrates robust backend functionalities essential for managing product listings, user accounts, Utilizing a structured PHP architecture like MVC ensures efficient data handling and scalability.
On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized to craft a responsive and user-friendly interface. Clients benefit from intuitive browsing and shopping cart functionalities, while sellers access tools for product management and order fulfillment via dedicated dashboards. Features like order tracking, and profile management enhance the overall user experience... This project not only showcases technical proficiency in full-stack development but also demonstrates practical skills in building scalable and secure E-Commerce solutions.
